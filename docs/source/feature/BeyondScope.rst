Beyond skscope
==================

There are many solvers besides ``ScopeSolver`` in :ref:`skscope <scope_package>`.
These solvers has similar interface as ``ScopeSolver`` and can be used for solving the same problem.
Here we list them.

``HTPSolver``
----------------

``HTPSolver`` is a solver which is based on the hard thresholding pursuit (HTP) algorithm. 


``IHTSolver``
----------------

``IHTSolver`` is a solver which is based on the iterative hard thresholding (IHT) algorithm. 

``GraspSolver``
------------------

``GraspSolver`` is a solver which is based on the Gradient Support Pursuit (GraSP) algorithm, which is inspired by and generalizes the Compressive Sampling Matching Pursuit (CoSaMP) algorithm.


``FobaSolver``
------------------

``FobaSolver`` is a solver which is based on the Forward-Backward greedy algorithm.

``ForwardSolver``
------------------

``ForwardSolver`` is a solver which is based on the forward selection algorithm.

``OMPSolver``
------------------

``OMPSolver`` is a solver which is based on the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm.
